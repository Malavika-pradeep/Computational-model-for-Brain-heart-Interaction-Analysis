# Computational-model-for-Brain-heart-Interaction-Analysis

This repository presents a cross-modal machine learning pipeline designed to explore brain-heart interactions for cognitive state classification, leveraging EEG, ECG, and synthetic physiological signals. The project demonstrates how ECG-derived features can approximate EEG cognitive markers, enabling non-invasive mental state monitoring via wearable devices.




üöÄ Project Highlights

‚Ä¢Multimodal Dataset: EEG, ECG, and other physiological signals recorded during memory and listening tasks from OpenNeuro.
‚Ä¢Low-Cost Cognitive Monitoring: Demonstrates potential of ECG alone to infer cognitive states, paving the way for wearable mental health monitoring.
‚Ä¢Synthetic Data Generation: Poincar√© Sympathetic-Vagal Synthetic Data Generation (SV-SDG) model simulates realistic HRV signals influenced by brain activity.
‚Ä¢ Cross-Modal Learning Framework: Maps ECG features to EEG space, enabling cognitive state classification using only ECG signals.
‚Ä¢Model Explainability: SHAP and t-SNE visualizations enhance transparency and interpretability.

‚Ä¢Connectivity measures
‚Ä¢Catch-22 time series descriptors
ECG Features:
‚Ä¢Heart Rate Variability (HRV): meanNN, SDNN, RMSSD, SD1, SD2
‚Ä¢Catch-22 time series descriptors

‚úÖ Synthetic Data Generation: SV-SDG Model
‚Ä¢Generates synthetic HRV signals using Poincar√© plot dynamics.
