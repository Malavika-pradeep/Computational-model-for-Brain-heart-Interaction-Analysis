# Computational-model-for-Brain-heart-Interaction-Analysis

This repository presents a cross-modal machine learning pipeline designed to explore brain-heart interactions for cognitive state classification, leveraging EEG, ECG, and synthetic physiological signals. The project demonstrates how ECG-derived features can approximate EEG cognitive markers, enabling non-invasive mental state monitoring via wearable devices.


🚀 Project Highlights

Multimodal Dataset: EEG, ECG, and other physiological signals recorded during memory and listening tasks from OpenNeuro.

Low-Cost Cognitive Monitoring: Demonstrates potential of ECG alone to infer cognitive states, paving the way for wearable mental health monitoring.

Synthetic Data Generation: Poincaré Sympathetic-Vagal Synthetic Data Generation (SV-SDG) model simulates realistic HRV signals influenced by brain activity.

Cross-Modal Learning Framework: Maps ECG features to EEG space, enabling cognitive state classification using only ECG signals.

Model Explainability: SHAP and t-SNE visualizations enhance transparency and interpretability.
