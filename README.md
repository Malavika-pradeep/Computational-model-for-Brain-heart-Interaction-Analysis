# Computational-model-for-Brain-heart-Interaction-Analysis

This project investigates the bidirectional communication between the brain and heart using EEG and ECG signals, focusing on cognitive functions like memory and attention. By extracting spectral EEG features and HRV parameters from OpenNeuro datasets, it explores classifying cognitive states such as passive listening and memory tasks using only ECG data. A cross-modal framework is proposed where HRV features are used to regress EEG features via XGBoost, enabling EEG-based classification from ECG signals.

 Additionally,the Poincar√© Sympathetic-Vagal Synthetic Data Generation (PSV-SDG) model is introduced to generate synthetic HRV data, enhancing model robustness and supporting real-world mental state monitoring through wearable technologies.
